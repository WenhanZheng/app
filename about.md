> We designed our data app basing on the stream game dataset. This dataset includes the name of the stream games, the published date of games and the genres of the games.

## Data app Image

Firstly, our data application is designed to provide game developers with data on popular games from the past few years so that they can develop new popular games.

In the first image, we can see a bar chart of statistics for the characteristics of the popular games that the user can select to view for different years.
